# SVD-image-classification
Singular Value Decomposition for Image Classification

The aim of this project is classify the given hand-written digital numbers (only 1 and 8) into two class.

**Project Definition**

We were given the set of handwritten 8 and 1 and wanted to classify test data by using SVD. 

The steps that are going to be followed like,

1- Upload the training dataset

2- Exhibit them to see how it looks like

3- Factorize the dataset by following the Singular Value Decomposition

4- Visualize the basis of the factorized dataset

5- Upload the test dataset

6- And classify the test dataset
